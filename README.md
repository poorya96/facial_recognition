# Face Recognition with Raspberry Pi Using a Smartphone Camera

## Overview
This project implements real-time face recognition on a Raspberry Pi using an IP camera (smartphone camera) as the video source. The system detects faces, matches them with known individuals, and controls a GPIO pin based on authentication status.

## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Uses a smartphone camera as an IP camera
- Controls a GPIO pin (e.g., LED) for authorized faces
- Displays FPS (frames per second) for performance monitoring

## Requirements
- **Hardware:**
  - Raspberry Pi (Pi 4, Pi 5, etc.)
  - LED (optional, for GPIO control)
- **Software & Libraries:**
  - Python 3
  - OpenCV (`cv2`)
  - `face_recognition` library
  - `numpy`
  - `picamera2` (if using Raspberry Pi Camera)
  - `gpiozero` (for GPIO control)
  - `pickle` (for storing known face encodings)
  - An IP camera app on your smartphone (e.g., **DroidCam**, **IP Webcam**)

## Installation
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install python3-opencv
   pip install face_recognition numpy gpiozero picamera2
   ```
2. **Enable camera module on Raspberry Pi:**
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
   - Go to **Interface Options** -> Enable **Camera**
   - Reboot the Raspberry Pi

3. **Set up the IP Camera:**
   - Install **DroidCam** (Android) or **IP Webcam**
   - Start streaming and note the camera URL (e.g., `http://192.168.X.X:4747/video`)

## Usage
1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python face_recognition_pi.py
   ```
2. If an authorized face is detected, the LED connected to GPIO 14 will turn **ON**, otherwise, it will stay **OFF**.
3. Press `q` to exit.

## Connecting the LED to GPIO 14
- Connect the **positive leg** (anode) of the LED to **GPIO 14**.
- Connect the **negative leg** (cathode) to a **330Î© resistor**, then to **GND**.

## Customization
- **Change the IP Camera URL:**
  Update `IP_CAMERA_URL` in the script:
  ```python
  IP_CAMERA_URL = "http://192.168.X.X:4747/video"
  ```
- **Add known faces:**
  - Collect images of known people.
  - Use `face_recognition` to encode them and save them in `encodings.pickle`.
- **Modify authorized users:**
  Update `authorized_names` in the script:
  ```python
  authorized_names = ["john", "mary"]  # Case-sensitive
  ```

## Troubleshooting
- If the video does not appear, ensure the IP camera URL is correct and reachable.
- If face recognition is slow, reduce the `cv_scaler` value for performance optimization.
- If GPIO does not respond, check your wiring and run the script with `sudo`.
